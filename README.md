# Arduino_NANO_Ble_Object_recognition
I am excited to share my recent project on LinkedIn, a simple proof of concept for object recognition AI, powered by the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. This
innovative model can identify eight types of basic monochromatic objects: 🍒🦋🪑🐿️🐦🎸🌳. You can explore the model and its functionalities on the Edge
Impulse platform by following this link: https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/studio/272255 .

Hardware Components:

Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense: At the heart of this project, the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense provides us with wireless capabilities and a variety of sensors to
enhance object recognition.

OV7675 Camera: To capture images of the objects we aim to recognize, we employ the OV7675 camera module.

1.12" Seeed OLED Display: Our choice of a Seeed OLED display, with a 1.12" screen, allows for clear and user-friendly presentation of the object recognition
results.

Tiny Machine Learning Shield: This shield plays a pivotal role in executing machine learning models on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, making it possible 
for our object recognition AI to operate efficiently.

I invite you to visit my LinkedIn post (linked here https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7106010500806680577/ ) to delve deeper into the 
details of this project and learn about the exciting implications of this object recognition AI prototype. Your feedback and engagement are greatly
appreciated as we explore the possibilities of AI on the edge.
